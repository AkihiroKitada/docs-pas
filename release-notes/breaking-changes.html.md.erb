This topic describes the breaking changes you need to be aware of when upgrading to <%= vars.v_major_version %>.
For more information about important preparation steps you must follow before beginning an upgrade,
see [Upgrading <%= vars.platform_name %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).

In addition, this topic lists of components that are either at their end-of-life (EOL) or nearing EOL. Components that are EOL may impact certain apps or deployments that depend on them. 

For more information, see [End-of-Life Components](#end-of-life).









## <a id='pas'></a> <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

See the following <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> breaking changes:

### <a id='credhub-interpolate-with-https'></a> Incorrect HTTP(S) Proxy Configuration Breaks CredHub Interpolation for Apps in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.9.6 and Later

In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.9.6 and later, apps that have an incorrect HTTP(S) Proxy configuration fail to stage or restart due to a CredHub interpolation error. 

Before you upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.9.6 or later, you must fix the HTTP(S) Proxy configuration of any impacted applications:

1. Determine whether your apps are impacted by following the resolution procedure in [Knowledgebase Article 9305](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Credhub-Reference-Can-t-Be-Interpolated-Due-To-Improper-HTTP-S-Proxy-Configuration).
1. Update all impacted apps to use the recommended proxy settings that are documented in [Configuring Proxy Settings for All Apps](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-9/operating/config-proxy.html).
1. Restart modified apps.

### <a id='nats-listens-to-more-ports'></a> NAT Listens to Additional Ports

In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> and later, NATS listens on the following ports:

* `4222`
* `4223`
* `4224`
* `4225`

In earlier version, NAT only listened on port `4222`. Before upgrading to
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must also open ports `4223`, `4224`, and `4225` in your
firewall settings.

### <a id='disable-hostname-validation'></a> Disable Hostname Validation for External Databases on GCP and Azure

This breaking change applies only to deployments where the following
conditions are met:

* In the **Databases** pane, PAS v2.8 is
configured to use an external GCP or Azure database.

* In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>,
you want to use the same external GCP or Azure database configured
in the **Databases** pane.

* You enabled TLS communication for the GCP or Azure external database by adding a certificate authority (CA) certificate to the **Database CA certificate** field in the **Databases** pane. 

If your deployment meets these conditions, you must disable hostname validation
before you upgrade to <%= vars.v_major_version %>.
Failure to disable hostname validation can cause the upgrade to fail
for deployments that use external databases on GCP or Azure.

For more information about disabling hostname validation, see [Disable Hostname Validation for External Databases on GCP and Azure](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-9/upgrading/checklist.html#disable-hostname-validation) in _Upgrade Preparation Checklist_.

### <a id='apps-manager-app-metrics-link-no-proxy'></a>App Metrics Link Disappears in Apps Manager for Proxied Setups

This breaking change applies to deployments that have any version of PCF Metrics or App Metrics installed.

If your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment has restrictive networking policies around request proxying, then the **View in App Metrics** link may no longer appear in Apps Manager after you upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.9.

To resolve this issue, follow the steps in the related [known issue](runtime-rn.html#apps-manager-app-metrics-link-no-proxy) of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> release notes before or after upgrading to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.9.

### <a id='autoscaler-apps-manager-no-proxy'></a>Autoscaler Controls Do Not Appear in Apps Manager for Proxied Setups

This breaking change applies to deployments that manage the Autoscaler service for individual apps in Apps Manager.

If your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment has restrictive networking policies around request proxying, then Autoscaler controls may not appear for apps within Apps Manager even when the Autoscaler service is enabled for an org.

To resolve this issue, follow the steps in the related [known issue](runtime-rn.html#autoscaler-apps-manager-no-proxy) of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> release notes before or after upgrading to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.9.

See the following <%= vars.segment_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> breaking change:

### <a id='credhub-interpolate-with-https-iso'></a> Incorrect HTTP(S) Proxy Configuration Breaks CredHub Interpolation for Apps in <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> v2.9.6 and Later

In <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> v2.9.6 and later, apps that have an incorrect HTTP(S) Proxy configuration fail to stage or restart due to a CredHub interpolation error. 

Before you upgrade to <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> v2.9.6 or later, you must fix the HTTP(S) Proxy configuration of any impacted applications:

1. Determine whether your apps are impacted by following the resolution procedure in [Knowledgebase Article 9305](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Credhub-Reference-Can-t-Be-Interpolated-Due-To-Improper-HTTP-S-Proxy-Configuration).
1. Update all impacted apps to use the recommended proxy settings that are documented in [Configuring Proxy Settings for All Apps](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-9/operating/config-proxy.html).
1. Restart modified apps.





## <a id='end-of-life'></a> End-of-Life Components

This section lists of components that are either at their end-of-life (EOL) or nearing EOL.

### <a id='buildpack'></a> Buildpack Support Changes

This section lists support changes to buildpacks associated with this release:

* **.NET Core Buildpack**: Support for dotnet-runtime versions 3.0.x will be removed in the first release of the .NET Core buildpack after March 3, 2020.

* **Node.js Buildpack**: Node.js v8.x is removed from the Node.js buildpack v1.7.9 and later because Node.js v8.x is out of support. This removal is known to break App Metrics v1.6.0 to v1.6.2 since those versions of App Metrics rely on Node.js v8.0.

* **Python**: Python v2.7 is removed from the buildpack that ships with TAS for VMs v2.9.0.

If your app depends on any of these language distributions and use the buildpacks packaged for TAS for VMs, you should consider updating the apps and their dependencies prior to upgrading to TAS for VMs v2.9.0.

### <a id='2-6'></a> Ops Manager v2.6 and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.6

Shortly after Ops Manager and TAS for VMs v2.9 are released, Ops Manager v2.6 and PAS v2.6 reach their end of general support.
