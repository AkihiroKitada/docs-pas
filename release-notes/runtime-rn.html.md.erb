## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

To upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11, see [Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> for Upgrades](../../operating/configuring.html).

When upgrading to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11, be aware of the following upgrade considerations:

* <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 is compatible with <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10. If you are using a previous version of <%= vars.ops_manager %>, you must upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 before you upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11.

* If you are upgrading from Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.7 or <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.8 and later, you can upgrade directly to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11.
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 is an LTS version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
See [Long-Term Support for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11](#lts) below for more information.

* If you are upgrading from PAS v2.6 or earlier, you must upgrade to PAS v2.7 before you upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11.

* Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11.
  VMware is working with partners to ensure their tiles are updated to work with the latest versions of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
  <br/><br/> For information about which partner service releases are currently compatible with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
  v2.11, review the appropriate partners services release documentation
  at [https://docs.pivotal.io](https://docs.pivotal.io) or contact the partner organization that produces the tile.


## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 includes the following major features:

### <a id='lts'></a> Long-Term Support for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 is a long-term supported (LTS) version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 will be supported through April 2024.

Over the lifecycle of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11, <%= vars.company_name %> will release security patches that occasionally include feature enhancements and maintenance updates.
<%= vars.company_name %> will also continue to release new versions of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

You can jump upgrade directly from previous versions of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to the LTS version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
For more information, see [Jump Upgrading to TAS for VMs v2.11](../../operating/jump-upgrades.html).

### <a id='vcf-compatibility'></a> Deployment on VMware Cloud Foundation

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 can be deployed on VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) v4.1. For
instructions and more information, see
[Deploying TAS for VMs to VCF](../../operating/vmc.html).

### <a id='vmc-compatibility'></a> Deployment on VMware Cloud on Amazon Web Services

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 can be deployed to VMware Cloud (VMC) on
Amazon Web Services (AWS). For instructions and more information, see
[Deploying TAS for VMs to VMC](../../operating/vcf.html).

### <a id='timestamps'></a> Optionally Use Human-Readable Timestamps for Component Logs

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 introduces RFC3339 log format support for several <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> components. You can configure these components to produce logs with human-readable RFC3339 timestamps with the **Timestamp format for component logs** configuration option in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. Logs that use human-readable timestamps are often easier to debug.

RFC3339-formatted timestamps follow the RFC3339 spec, include nine points of precision where possible, and are in UTC. For example:

* 2019-11-21T22:16:18.750673404Z
* 2019-11-21T22:16:18.750000000Z

For more information about configuring the **Timestamp format for component logs** field, see [System Logging](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/configure-pas.html#sys-logging) in _Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.

In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11.0, if you select the **Converge to human-readable RFC3339 format** option under **Timestamp format for component logs**, then the following components and related jobs use RFC3339 timestamps:

| Component | Jobs |
| ------------ | ----- |
| `Logging` | `log-cache-nozzle`, `loggregator_agent`, `loggr-forwarder-agent`, `loggr-syslog-agent`, `prom_scraper`, `doppler`, `loggregator_trafficcontroller`, `reverse_log_proxy`, `reverse_log_proxy_gateway`, `log-cache-cf-auth-proxy`, `log-cache-gateway`, `log-cache-syslog-server`, `log-cache`, `loggr-syslog-binding-cache`, `loggr-upd-forwarder`, `syslog_forwarder` |
| `CAPI` | `cc_deployment_updater`, `cc_uploader`, `cloud_controller_clock`, `cloud_controller_ng`, `cloud_controller_worker`, `rotate_cc_database_key`, `tps` |
| `UAA` | `uaa` |

This new feature is related to a breaking change. For more information, see <a href='#timestamps-breaking-change'>Timestamps for Component Logs in Diego Logs when Upgrading</a> below.

### <a id='cloud-foundry-v3-api-availability'></a> Cloud Foundry V3 APIs Availability

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 supports Cloud Foundry V3 APIs. This feature improves response
time when working with services. Use the Cloud Foundry V3 API endpoints when listing, creating, or
modifying any service that works with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 and later.

## <a id='resolved-issues'></a> Resolved Issues

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 includes the following resolved issues:

### <a id='credhub-encryption-key'></a> CredHub Primary Encryption Key Verification

When you configure the CredHub server for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, you must select a primary encryption key.
In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11, if you do not select a primary encryption key, or if you mark more than one key as the primary encryption key, deployment fails more quickly than in previous releases of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

For more information, see [Configure CredHub](../../operating/configure-pas.html#credhub) in _Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.

## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 includes the following breaking changes:

### <a id='transfer-encoding-stricter'></a> Gorouter Update to Golang v1.15 Introduces Stricter Transfer-Encoding Header Standards in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11.0 and Later

In <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11.0 and later,
stricter header standards break Spring apps
that incorrectly set the header.

For more details, see the
[Applications on TAS for VMs get 502 chunked response error](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Application-Chunked-Error?language=en_US)
knowledge base article.

This breaking change was _also present_
in later patch versions of v2.7, v2.8, v2.9, and v2.10 of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
but is listed again here,
because it is possible to jumpgrade
directly from a pre-breaking-change patch to  v2.11.

If you have not yet encountered this breaking change,
you may be on a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> version prior to v2.7.30, v2.8.24, v2.9.20, or 2.10.10.

If this is the case, you should upgrade to a version with a stop-gap version
of the rouring release
prior to upgrading to 2.11.0,
so that you can determine if you have any effected apps.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.7.31, v2.8.25, v2.9.21, and 2.10.11 include
a patch release to Gorouter that emits logs,
emits metrics, and does not error out
when an app response contains a duplicate
<code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> header.
These releases includes a stop-gap fix
to discover which apps are sending invalid responses.
This fix is not present in subsequent patch releases.
For more details, see the
[Applications on TAS for VMs get 502 chunked response error](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Application-Chunked-Error?language=en_US)
knowledge base article.

Before you upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11.00 or later,
you must follow the resolution steps in the above referenced KB article to fix the apps.

### <a id='timestamps-breaking-change'></a> Timestamps for Component Logs in Diego Logs when Upgrading

The <strong>Timestamp format for component logs</strong> feature replaces the <strong>Format of timestamps in Diego logs</strong> feature in the <strong>App Containers</strong> pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. However, when you upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11, the option that was selected under <strong>Format of timestamps in Diego logs</strong> in your previous deployment is applied to <strong>Timestamp format for component logs</strong>. For more information, see <a href='#timestamps'>Timestamp Format for Component Logs Replaces Timestamp Format for Diego Logs</a>.

### <a id="dynamic-egress"></a> Dynamic Egress Policies Are Removed

You cannot upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 if you are using Dynamic Egress policies.

To see if you have Dynamic Egress policies, see [List Egress Policies](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-10/devguide/egress-policies.html#list-egress-policies) in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.10 documentation.

To delete each of your policies, see [Delete an Egress Policy](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-10/devguide/egress-policies.html#delete-egress-policies) in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.10 documentation.

## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues

There are no known issues in this release of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
