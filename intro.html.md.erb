This topic gives a high-level conceptual overview and introduction to Pivotal Application Service (PAS). It is designed
to:

* Introduce the platform to people who are unfamiliar with it.

* Provide context and explanations that support the information in the PCF Documentation's role-based guides.

* Explain how you can get started running apps on PCF in two ways:

  - Install and run [<%= vars.product_name %> Dev](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-dev/index.html), a free, lightweight version of PAS that enables you to develop and run apps on your local workstation.

  - Subscribe to [Pivotal Web Services](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/starting/index.html) (PWS), a full PAS platform hosted by Pivotal.
