The topics in this subsection serve as a guide for PAS developers. They explain how to develop, run, and manage apps on Pivotal Application Service (PAS).


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Developing, running, and managing apps on PAS may include:

* Deploying and scaling apps with diverse languages, frameworks, and dependencies
* Finding software services in the services marketplace, such as databases, email, or message servers
* Creating your own Cloud Foundry service based on an external server
* Creating service instances and binding them to your apps
* Streaming app logs to an external log management service
* Troubleshooting app deployment and health

If you do these things, you are a PAS **Developer**, and the contents of this guide are for you.
