##<a id='who'></a>Introduction

This topic gives a high-level conceptual overview and introduction to Pivotal Application Service (PAS). It is designed to:

* Introduce the PAS runtime to people who are unfamiliar with it.

* Provide context and explanations that support the how-to information in the Pivotal documentation's role-based guides.

* Explain how you can get started running apps on PAS in two ways:

  - Install and run <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-dev/index.html"><%= vars.product_name %> Dev</a>, a free, lightweight version of PAS that enables you to develop and run  apps on your local workstation.

  - Subscribe to <a href="http://docs.run.pivotal.io/starting/index.html">Pivotal Web Services</a> (PWS), a full PAS platform hosted by Pivotal.

If you want to learn about how PAS works or test it out yourself, this guide is for you.
