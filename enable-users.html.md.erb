<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The topics in this subsection explain how to manage user accounts and enable the users of a Pivotal Elastic Runtime on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='overview'></a>Overview

Elastic Runtime is an opinionated development environment with built-in structures to compartmentalize, support, and track multiple independent app development teams. Enabling Elastic Runtime users means:

* Inviting new users and assigning user roles
* Setting up and managing user notifications
* Setting up orgs, spaces, and segments for developer users to work in
* Giving developers access to software services and buildpacks
* Giving developers and security objects
* Enabling secure traffic between apps
* Integrating Elastic Runtime with container systems and development environments

In addition to these tasks, Elastic Runtime managers may also deploy apps, create service instances, and perform other tasks that [Elastic Runtime app developers](../devguide/index.html) do.
