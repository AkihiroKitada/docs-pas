##<a id='who'></a>Welcome to Pivotal Cloud Foundry

This guide gives a high-level conceptual overview and introduction to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) platform. It is designed to:

* Introduce the platform to people who are unfamiliar with it.

* Provide context and explanations that support the how-to information in the PCF Documentation's role-based guides.

* Explain how you can get started running apps on PCF in two ways:

  - Install and run <a href="/pcf-dev/index.html">PCF Dev</a>, a free, lightweight version of PCF that enables you to develop and run Pivotal Application Service (PAS) apps on your local workstation.

  - Subscribe to <a href="http://docs.run.pivotal.io/starting/index.html">Pivotal Web Services</a> (PWS), a full PCF platform hosted by Pivotal.

If you want to learn about how the PCF platform works or test it out yourself, this guide is for you.
