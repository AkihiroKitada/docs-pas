title: Managing the PAS Platform
owner: <%= vars.product_name %> Documentation

The topics in this subsection explain how to manage the structure and capabilities of an application runtime on <%= vars.first_product_name  %>, such as Pivotal Application Service (PAS).


## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

PAS-based runtimes are opinionated development environments with built-in structures to compartmentalize, support, and track multiple independent app development teams. Managing this environment includes:

* Managing routes and domains
* Managing orgs, spaces, and platform settings
* Generating app logs and usage reports

In addition to these tasks, PAS managers may also deploy apps, create service instances, and perform other tasks that PAS app developers do. For more information, see [Developer Guide](../devguide/index.html).
